"FATHER"

You are the backbone of family,
the smile to live happily,
the strength of your daughter.
we love you dear FATHER.

You are a support in the hardest time,
you create smooth path to climb,
you always hide your love and care,
But we love you dear FATHER.

You taught us beauty of simplicity,
because you always believe in humanity,
which makes our life easier,
we love you dear father.
